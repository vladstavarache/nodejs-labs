<!-- Hangman (Text-Based):**

- **Concepts:** Strings, arrays, loops, conditionals (if statements), user input
- **Gameplay:**
    - Choose a secret word.
    - Display the word representation with underscores (_ _) for each letter.
    - Allow the user to guess a letter.
    - If the letter is in the word, update the display to reveal the letter in its corresponding positions.
    - If the letter is not in the word, track the remaining guesses and display an appropriate message.
    - The game continues until the user guesses the word correctly or runs out of guesses.  -->
